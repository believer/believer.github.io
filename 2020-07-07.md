**Weather** ðŸŒ¤ 19Â° / 9Â°

I went for my longest run of the year yesterday [[2020-07-06]], [6.53 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/3722116149), and it felt great. I started out at a slower pace than I usually start at which benefited me in the long run. I could keep a fairly even pace through the whole run and even speed up towards the end. The joy of running has come back to me and I think it'll become even more fun if I get a bit lighter.

Started testing out [[Foam]] today. I've gotten used to the experience in [[Roam]] and even developed my own [theme](https://github.com/believer/roam-night-owl) for it. I'm going to give [[Foam]] a fair chance though, because I'm not ready to pay the high cost for [[Roam]] yet.
