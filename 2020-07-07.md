19Â° / 9Â° ðŸŒ¤

I went for my longest run of the year yesterday [[2020-07-06]], [6.53 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/3722116149){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}, and it felt great. I started out at a slower pace than I usually start at which benefited me in the long run. I could keep a fairly even pace through the whole run and even speed up towards the end. The joy of running has come back to me and I think it'll become even more fun if I get a bit lighter.

I started testing [[foam]] today. I've gotten used to the experience in [[roam]] and even developed my own [theme](https://github.com/believer/roam-night-owl){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"} for it. I'm going to give [[foam]] a fair chance though, because I'm not ready to pay the high cost for [[roam]] yet.

The new [[bucklescript]] syntax is starting to grow on me. I've converted a bunch of my personal projects to it and I have to say that it seems faster than before? Also enjoying the new features and it's great to see that the development speed seems to have increased as well. These are the personal projects that I've updated:

- [WCAG Color](https://github.com/believer/wcag-color){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Track duration](https://github.com/believer/track-duration){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [re-actual](https://github.com/believer/re-actual){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [re-intl](https://github.com/believer/re-intl){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}
