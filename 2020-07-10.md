# 2020-07-10

Today is my last day before vacation ðŸŽ‰

Went [[running]] yesterday, [[2020-07-09]]. It ended up being longer than the run on [[2020-07-07]] with a distance of [8.39 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/3736799275/overview){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener"}. Overall it felt good, but I had to start walking a couple of times because I felt tired. It was the first time that I ran this course so that might've also contributed to the feeling of exhaustion since I didn't know exactly where I was or where I was going at all times. I'm happy with the distance and I'm not feeling much soreness today either which is great. I need to keep this running flow up now.

I did a large refactor of [[hemnet]]'s component library today where I rewrote all tests using [[testing-library-react]]. I love writing tests in it. It feels natural and encourages you to use good testing practices.
