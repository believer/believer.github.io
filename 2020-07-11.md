## Did you learn anything new today?

I had forgotten how to setup up my tent, a [[hilleberg]] [[anjan-gt-2]]. I got the tent stood up with the tent poles and the stakes. What I had forgotten was at which angle the guidelines should be set up from the tent. Was is 90 or 45 degrees at this position? I also forgot to tighten the straps for the tent poles. These two things made the opening super hard to close.

I started learning [[type-graphql]][yesterday](2020-07-10). It seems great, especially paired with [[typeorm]] and [[postgresql]]. It's a lot of [[typescript]]-magic using decorators, but it feels more type-safe. At least compared to straight-up [[apollo]], which I've been using for almost every [[graphql]] [[api]] I've built in the past. I also think it'll help in the long run when you get used to the decorators which will remove having to handle an ever-growing schema definition and you don't need to use type generation from a third-party library.

I had fun cutting down a tree that had died here at [[landet]]. Currently, I thoroughly enjoy working outside. I think I have gotten inspired by [[beau-miles]] and by watching [[tv-hjälp-vi-har-köpt-en-bondgård]]. Had to cut the cleanup part short though due to rain.
