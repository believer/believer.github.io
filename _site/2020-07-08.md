## Tasks

- [x] Test if [[mjml]] would be a good framework for building emails

After some basic testing, [[mjml]] seems fantastic. Not having to interact directly with `<table>` is great and it seems to have good defaults. It also creates a lot of [[outlook]] magic automatically that you would probably miss (I know I didn't do it) when writing the templates by hand. I will keep it in mind for when I have to create email templates the next time.

- [x] Throw away stuff from closet cleanup at [[hagby-vc]] with [[jessica-djurberg]]
