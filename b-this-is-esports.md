## Highlights

- This is what Deathmatch 95, what [[bill-gates]] in a trench coat and tent made of sex toys, begat.
- Are you seeing the chain here? Step one: Fan base. Step two: Mods. Step three: Esports. Step four: Profit.
- North America and Europe have always had a porous border when it comes to culture (the US sends us Hollywood movies, we send them cheese that isn’t the colour of Fanta, tit for tat).
- It needs to understand that gaming is a mainstream leisure activity happening across all kinds of demographics, in a range of varying contexts with their own unique conditions, and across a multitude of devices and genres.
