**Weather** ðŸŒ¤ 19Â° / 9Â°

I went for my longest run of the year yesterday [[July 6th, 2020]], [6.53 km](https://www.strava.com/activities/3722116149), and it felt great. I started out at a slower pace than I usually start at which benefited me in the long run. I could keep a fairly even pace through the whole run and even speed up towards the end. The joy of running has come back to me and I think it'll become even more fun if I get a bit lighter.
