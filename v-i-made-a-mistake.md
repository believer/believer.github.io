## Highlights

I'm bad at admitting when I've made a mistake. I see it as failure and weakness. This is a bad thing and it is something that I need to work on. The other day when [[jessica-djurberg]] and I were cleaning out the closet I accidentally stepped on her pizza stone that was on the floor and it broke. Instead of immediately saying "I'm sorry", I brushed it off like it was her mistake for putting it on the floor. After a while, I felt bad and apologized, but this should've been the immediate reaction.

[[bob-ross]] used to say "We don't make mistakes, we have happy accidents". To me, that means that you should **learn and improve** from your mistakes and not dwell on them. Move forward and do better.
