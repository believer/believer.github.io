## Highlights

- I love the idea of using stuff you already own to create something new. Not just throw away fully functioning desks. I mean, I love getting rid of stuff too, but if you can repurpose something it just feels a whole lot better.

- 12900 AUD!? (~82000 SEK / ~$ 8300). For that small of a job? That's just crazy.

- The more I see Beau the more I think of [[kalle-zackari-wahlström]]. Similar in style and manners and both of the seem like guys you'd like to hang around. All sorts of adventures.
