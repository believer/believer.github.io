## Highlights

It's beautiful seeing the landscape of [[australia]] and the old remains of the train line as [[beau-miles]] runs the 43 km long stretch.

Easy and enjoyable as always, perfect video when you wake up too early (05:30) and need something motivating to start the day off.

Who would've thought that a grass-covered little hill in the middle of a field was once a train station? This makes me think of what's out here to find, where I live? Might need to stretch out my runs to more unseen places.
